1) How to run the tests without starting the webdriver-manager start?

Remove seleniumAddress in the configuration file
So protactor randomly picks a port and runs on it

Disadvantage:
This doesn't work when we the test as to run on firefox / ie

2) how to make a test run on firefox / IE?

should add the below variable in the configuration file

capabilities: {
  'browserName': 'firefox'
}

For IE, to update the ie webdriver using webdriver manager since IE doesnt come with the default
webdriver manager update

webdriver-manager update --ie

then add the below variable in the configuration file

capabilities: {
'browserName': 'internet explorer',
 },
